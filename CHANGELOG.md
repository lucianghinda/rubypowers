# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [8.0.0] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- **Breaking rename and migration:** RubyPowers replaces the `superpowers-ruby`
  plugin name and skill prefix in version 8.0.0. Reinstall as
  `rubypowers@rubypowers` on plugin platforms. Existing projects keep their
  `docs/superpowers/` plans and specs, which the skills continue to read; new
  projects use `docs/rubypowers/` by default. The OpenCode, Codex, and README
  guides document platform-specific migration steps.

## [7.5.0] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **rails-upgrade skill — incorrect version facts across four reference files**: Five claims were wrong and each would have misdirected an upgrade. (1) The built-in **Sidekiq** ActiveJob adapter was listed as *removed* in Rails 8.1; it was only **deprecated** in 8.1 and is removed in 8.2. **SuckerPunch** is the adapter actually removed in 8.1. The two appear adjacent in the same 8.1 release-note block, one "Deprecate" and one "Remove", and collapsing them sent readers chasing a break that does not exist while missing the one that does. Corrected in `breaking-changes.md`, `deprecation-timeline.md`, `detection-patterns.md`, and the `gem-compatibility.md` footnotes. (2) `pool:` in `database.yml` was listed as deprecated in 8.0 and removed in 8.1 with a deprecation warning; Rails 8.1 **renamed** `pool` to `max_connections` alongside the new `keepalive`, `max_age`, and `min_connections` options, default behavior is unchanged, and `pool:` continues to work — so it was demoted from HIGH to LOW priority. (3) The old form helper names `text_area` / `check_box` / `rich_text_area` were listed as deprecated in 8.0 with removal in 8.2+; they were never deprecated — Rails 8.0 added `textarea` / `checkbox` / `rich_textarea` as *aliases*, which the same file already stated correctly two sections earlier. (4) `config.active_record.postgresql_adapter_decode_dates` was attributed to `load_defaults 8.1`; it is a **7.2** default. (5) The `load_defaults 8.0` entry listed `show_exceptions: :rescuable`, `cache_format_version 8.0`, and "Solid gems enabled by default"; the actual 8.0 defaults are `Regexp.timeout = 1` and `config.action_dispatch.strict_freshness = true`, and Solid Cache/Queue/Cable adoption is a generator change that no `load_defaults` bump performs. All corrections verified against `guides/source/configuring.md` on `main`, whose "Default Values for Target Version X.Y" lists are generated from the framework's own defaults and therefore cannot drift from the code the way prose can.
- **rails-upgrade skill — `fetch-changelogs.sh` rejected security-release versions**: The version validator was `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$`, allowing at most three segments. Rails security releases carry a fourth (`8.1.3.1`, `8.0.5.1`, `7.2.3.2`), so `./fetch-changelogs.sh 8.1.3.1` failed with "does not look like a valid version number" — meaning the script could not fetch changelogs for the exact version an upgrade should target. Widened to `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){0,2}$` and the error message now states the accepted shapes.

### Changed

- **rails-upgrade skill — Rails 8.0 → 8.1 re-rated and rewritten**: Previously rated **Easy / 2-4 hours** with 8 documented changes; now **Medium / 1-2 days** with ~28. The under-count traced to a sourcing gap: the official upgrading guide lists exactly *one* item for this hop (alphabetical `schema.rb` columns), so anything built from the guide alone misses the release notes and per-component CHANGELOGs where the real removals live. Newly documented as HIGH: `ActiveRecord::MissingRequiredOrderError` — under `load_defaults 8.1`, `#first`/`#last`/`#second` raise on an unordered relation whose model has no `implicit_order_column`, `query_constraints`, or `primary_key`, which lands as a broad wave of test failures rather than a single boot error and is now the highest-breadth change in the 8.x line; path-relative redirects raising `UnsafeRedirectError`; `escape_json_responses = false` and `escape_js_separators_in_json = false` changing rendered JSON; and the alphabetical `schema.rb` sorting, flagged with the fact that it was **already reverted on `main`** for 8.2 because it produces improper production tables under `db:prepare`. Adds ~15 previously-undocumented removals (`Benchmark.ms`, `bin/rake stats`, `STATS_DIRECTORIES`, `rails/console/methods.rb`, SQLite3 `:retries`, MySQL `:unsigned_float`/`:unsigned_decimal`, route-to-multiple-paths, leading brackets in parameter names, `Time#since` with a `Time`, `enqueue_after_transaction_commit` symbol values) and 10 deprecations that become 8.2 errors (`mb_chars`, `Multibyte::Chars`, `to_time_preserves_timezone`, `ActiveSupport::Configurable`, `signed_id_verifier_secret`, `insert_all`/`upsert_all` on unpersisted associations, `WITH`/`DISTINCT` with `update_all`, private `#klass` on custom job serializers, the Action Text Trix APIs, `render_in` without keyword arguments).
- **rails-upgrade skill — release landscape and Ruby floor**: `SKILL.md` gains a release-landscape table (8.1.3.1 current stable, 8.0.5.1 maintained, 7.2.3.2 security-only, 8.2.0.alpha in development) and a Step 0 requirement to resolve a target to an exact patch rather than a minor, since upgrading to `8.1.0` while `8.1.3.1` exists leaves known CVEs unpatched. The Ruby compatibility table splits the former `8.0+` row into `8.0–8.1` (Ruby 3.2.0) and `8.2` (Ruby **3.3.1**), with guidance to bump Ruby while still on 8.1 so the interpreter and framework changes are debugged separately.

### Added

- **rails-upgrade skill — Rails 8.1 → 8.2 coverage (clearly marked unreleased)**: New sections in `breaking-changes.md`, `deprecation-timeline.md`, `detection-patterns.md`, `load-defaults-guide.md`, `gem-compatibility.md`, and `troubleshooting.md`, plus an "Upgrading to Rails 8.2" section in `SKILL.md`. Rails 8.2 is `8.2.0.alpha` on `main` and has not shipped, so every section carries that status and an instruction to re-verify. The coverage earns its place because 8.1's own deprecation warnings name 8.2 as the removal version — an 8.1 warning cannot be triaged correctly without knowing what 8.2 does with it — and because every 8.2 fix already works on 8.1. Documents the Ruby 3.3.1 floor, removal of the Active Record 6.1 marshalling format (which requires flushing caches *before* upgrading), negative enum scopes now including `nil` records, the SQLite 3.35.0 and PostgreSQL 10.0 minimums, the `Sec-Fetch-Site` CSRF strategy, `protect_from_forgery` requiring an explicit strategy, the `RedisCacheStore` move from `redis` to `redis-client`, and the further deprecation of the built-in `resque`, `delayed_job`, `backburner`, `sneakers`, and `queue_classic` adapters. Closes with a "prepare while on 8.1" ordering that clears the entire 8.2 HIGH list from 8.1.
- **rails-upgrade skill — CVE-2026-66066 gate**: A new Step 0.5 in `SKILL.md`, a HIGH entry in `breaking-changes.md`, a detection pattern, and a troubleshooting section for the critical Active Storage arbitrary-file-read / RCE fixed in 8.1.3.1, 8.0.5.1, and 7.2.3.2. Treated as a workflow gate rather than a detection pattern because it cannot be found by grepping the application: the fix disables libvips "unfuzzed" loaders, and libvips below 8.13 cannot block them at all, so Rails **refuses to boot** — a system-library version, usually pinned in a Dockerfile, gates the upgrade. Also records that BMP, ICO, and PSD variant transformation now raises, that `:vips` is the default processor from `load_defaults 7.0` onward (so an absent config means the app *is* affected), the `VIPS_BLOCK_UNTRUSTED` and `Vips.block_untrusted(true)` stopgaps, and the secret-rotation list for apps that were exposed.
- **rails-upgrade skill — `fetch-changelogs.sh main`**: The script can now fetch the unreleased entries at the top of each component CHANGELOG on `main`. Released changelogs anchor on a `## Rails X.Y.Z (date) ##` header used as both start and stop marker; main-branch changelogs have no version headers at all, since Rails empties them when a release branch is cut, and terminate in a `Please check [x-y-stable](…) for previous changes.` pointer. The new `extract_unreleased_section()` reads from the top of the file, stops defensively at any `## Rails` header in case branch management changes upstream, strips the trailing pointer line as misleading inside a file labelled unreleased, and trims trailing blank lines so a component with no pending changes yields a genuinely empty string and hits the caller's existing SKIP branch. Output carries an explicit warning that entries can change or be reverted before release. Progress and error messages now print the resolved git ref rather than an unconditional `v` prefix, so `main` no longer displays as `vmain`.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- **brainstorming skill — hardened gate, rationalization counters, persist-as-you-go drafts** (contributed by @helphop): The HARD-GATE now requires *all* of design approved, spec written and committed, user review of the written spec, and `writing-plans` invoked — with chat approval ("looks good, go ahead") explicitly named as clearing only the next checklist item, not the gate. Adds a "When NOT to Use" section (debugging → `systematic-debugging`, plan execution → `executing-plans`, pure research → nothing to design), a rationalization table and Red Flags list built from excuses captured verbatim in baseline subagent tests, and a "Persist as you go" rule: create the spec as a `Status: DRAFT` file early and append each decision as it lands, so a crashed or compacted session loses nothing. The spec must now carry a `## Decisions` section quoting each user decision with a one-line rationale, which downstream spec reviews and plan-fidelity checks key off. Names `AskUserQuestion` for option rendering and allows batching up to 4 *genuinely independent* multiple-choice questions (dependent questions are never batched). Wires up the previously orphaned `spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md` as an optional fresh-context review for complex specs, and compresses the inline Visual Companion section ~40% (details already live in `visual-companion.md`; the verbatim offer script and own-message rule are kept). Developed test-first per `writing-skills`: subagent pressure scenarios were run against the old text first, and the tightened gate holds afterward even with the checklist removed from view. The description was also rewritten to `writing-skills` CSO rules — trigger-only, third person, no workflow summary — dropping the previous "You MUST" imperative; re-verified with `tests/skill-triggering` (brainstorming still fires from the naive prompt).

### Fixed

- **brainstorming skill — process flowchart out of sync**: The DOT graph still showed a single `Write design doc` node after design approval, contradicting the checklist's renamed "Finalize design doc" step and omitting the new persist-as-you-go draft entirely. Added a `Create DRAFT spec (append decisions as they land)` node on the clarifying-questions path — before the design exists, matching where the prose says drafting starts — and renamed the post-approval node to `Finalize design doc (promote DRAFT, add Decisions)`, including on the "changes requested" loop-back edge. Matters because the flowcharts are the authoritative process definition, so prose and graph disagreeing is a real ambiguity.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **ruby skill — method ordering & file layout**: Added a "Method Ordering & File Layout" section to the `ruby` skill plus a new `references/method_ordering.md`. Documents the top-to-bottom class layout (`extend`/`include` → constants → `attr_*`/macros → `initialize` → public → `protected` → `private`) and the core rule: order methods **breadth-first by abstraction altitude**, not depth-first by caller — cluster every method at one altitude, then the helpers they call, then their leaves. Frames the convention precisely (stepdown rule / SLAP / newspaper metaphor, named as a breadth-first traversal of the call tree) with a worked `SalesReportBuilder` example whose *bad* version is a real unguided-agent output, a "where shared helpers go" decision guide, a common-mistakes table, and recognized exceptions. Developed test-first per `writing-skills`: an unguided agent reproduced the depth-first feature-grouping trap, then a guided agent on a fresh `ShippingLabelPrinter` produced the correct breadth-first layout (sinking the shared `money` leaf to the bottom).

## [7.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Codex install docs**: Corrected Codex's plugin command from `codex plugin install superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby` to `codex plugin add superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby`, and updated uninstall guidance to use `codex plugin remove`.
- **Codex marketplace discovery**: Added Codex's required `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` index and a lightweight `plugins/superpowers-ruby` marketplace path so `codex plugin add superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby` can find the plugin after the marketplace is added or upgraded.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **ruby-upgrade skill**: Upgrades the Ruby *interpreter* version of a Bundler/Rails app, currently targeting the Ruby 3.x → 4.0.x jump. Runs a breaking-change risk audit via a single `Explore` subagent sweep, writes a stakeholder-ready analysis (`docs/ruby-upgrade/<date>/analysis.md`, falling back to `tmp/`), applies mechanical toolchain edits only where the old version was actually pinned (`.ruby-version`, Dockerfile, CI YAML, RuboCop `TargetRubyVersion`, Gemfile `cgi`/demoted-gem pins), then verifies with RuboCop, the test suite, and Sorbet/Tapioca when present. Ships a bundled breaking-change inventory (`references/ruby-4-0-changes.md`) verified against the upstream Ruby 4.0.0 release announcement: CGI session-class removal vs retained `cgi/escape`, `Net::HTTP` implicit Content-Type drop, demoted default gems, `Set` promoted to core + `Set#inspect` → `Set[...]`, `Ractor::Port` removals, `Kernel#open` pipe removal, `Process::Status` bitwise removal, OpenSSL 4, ZJIT (Rust 1.85.0+) vs YJIT. The description de-conflicts with `rails-upgrade` (interpreter version vs framework version) — verified by the skill-triggering test, which fires `ruby-upgrade` without collision.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Copilot CLI compatibility**: The 6 skills that previously declared `name: superpowers-ruby:<slug>` in their frontmatter (`compound`, `compound-refresh`, `consulting-an-oracle`, `handoff`, `handoff-list`, `handoff-resume`) now use bare names (`name: <slug>`), matching the other 28 skills. Copilot CLI's name validator rejects `:` in the `name:` field with `Skill name must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, dots, and spaces`, so those 6 skills failed to load. Bare names sidestep this because every loader auto-prepends `superpowers-ruby:` on display — any explicit prefix would double-prefix (`name: superpowers-ruby.handoff` would render as `/superpowers-ruby:superpowers-ruby.handoff` on Copilot). Supersedes [PR #12](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/12), which proposed the same fix with hyphens and would have hit the same double-prefix issue.

### Added

- **Codex plugin manifest**: Added `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` so the repo installs via Codex's native plugin system (`codex plugin marketplace add lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby` + `codex plugin add superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby`). The legacy symlink install (clone + `ln -s …skills ~/.agents/skills/`) remains supported for users already on it; see `.codex/INSTALL.md` for both paths and the migration guide.

### Changed

- **Skill cross-references normalized**: A handful of skill bodies (`compound`, `compound-refresh`, `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`, `writing-plans`, `writing-skills`, and others) referenced sibling skills as `superpowers:<slug>` (the OpenCode auto-prefix form, since the npm package is named `superpowers`). These references were normalized to `superpowers-ruby:<slug>` to match the catalog in `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` and the dominant convention used elsewhere in the repo. Picks up where the v6.0.0 namespace rename left off.

### Migration Guide

No action required for skill invocation — `/superpowers-ruby:handoff`, `/superpowers-ruby:compound`, etc. continue to work exactly as before. Codex users can optionally migrate from the legacy symlink install to the new plugin install (`rm ~/.agents/skills/superpowers-ruby` followed by the plugin install commands above); the symlink path remains supported indefinitely.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **consulting-an-oracle skill**: Packages a stalled in-session investigation into a self-contained oracle prompt at `tmp/oracle/<date>-<slug>.md` for a stronger one-shot model (GPT-5 Pro, Opus, Gemini Pro) to answer cold. Auto-detects Ruby/Rails project shape (Ruby version, framework, DB, test framework, jobs, asset pipeline, type tooling), pulls verbatim failure context and reconstructs hypothesis/action/outcome attempts from session history, walks one hop from the failing file (≤8 files / ≤2000 lines), and aggressively redacts secrets before write. The skill produces a file only — it does not call any model — keeping it model-agnostic and re-runnable. Includes a Ruby/Rails-specific suspect list (Zeitwerk autoloading, frozen string literals, thread safety, initializer order, gem version drift, monkey patches, environment differences) covering implicit context that an oracle cannot infer. Ships with three pressure tests and an academic comprehension test.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **using-sqlite-worktrees skill**: Copies Rails development SQLite databases (including Rails 8 Solid Queue/Cache/Cable multi-DB layouts) into a new git worktree's `storage/` directory. Handles WAL journal mode via `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before copy and includes `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar files. Backs up existing files as `*.bak` before overwrite. Ruby helper script ships inside the skill folder, invoked via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
- **using-git-worktrees integration**: Auto-delegates to `using-sqlite-worktrees` when a Rails project uses SQLite. Delegation runs after `bundle install` and before `bin/rails db:test:prepare`. If the delegated script fails, `using-git-worktrees` halts setup and reports "DB setup incomplete" rather than silently continuing.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **handoff skill**: Captures session state (goals, decisions, modified files, failed approaches, next steps) to `docs/handoffs/` so future sessions or different agents can resume seamlessly. Three commands: `superpowers-ruby:handoff` (create), `superpowers-ruby:handoff-resume` (restore), `superpowers-ruby:handoff-list` (browse).
- **Automatic compaction handoff**: `PreCompact`/`PostCompact` hooks (Claude Code) and `experimental.session.compacting`/`session.compacted` events (OpenCode) capture and restore handoff documents automatically around context compaction. Codex gets manual-only support.
- **Cross-agent handoff**: Handoff documents are plain markdown with YAML frontmatter, readable by any agent or tool. Supports Claude Code → OpenCode, agent → human, human → agent, and subagent → parent handoff scenarios.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **brainstorming**: Replaced Spec Review Loop (subagent dispatch + 3-iteration cap) with inline Spec Self-Review checklist: placeholder scan, internal consistency, scope check, ambiguity check. Eliminates a brittle multi-agent loop that doubled execution time.
- **writing-plans**: Replaced Plan Review Loop with inline Self-Review checklist: spec coverage, placeholder scan, type consistency. Added explicit "No Placeholders" section defining plan failures (TBD, vague descriptions, undefined references, "similar to Task N").

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot CLI support**: SessionStart hook detects `COPILOT_CLI` environment variable and emits SDK-standard `{ "additionalContext": "..." }` format. Added `references/copilot-tools.md` with full Claude Code → Copilot CLI tool equivalence table.
- **codex-tools**: Added named agent dispatch mapping documenting how to translate Claude Code's named agent types to Codex's `spawn_agent` with worker roles.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **rails-upgrade skill**: New self-contained skill for upgrading Rails applications (5.2 through 8.1). Merges the best of [OmbuLabs/FastRuby.io](https://github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_rails-upgrade-skill) and [Mario Alberto Chávez Cárdenas](https://github.com/mariochavez/rails-upgrade-skill) (both MIT). Features direct Grep/Glob/Read detection (no script round-trip), live config diffs via the railsdiff.org GitHub API, 3 hard gates (test baseline, load_defaults verification, user approval), and 7 reference files covering breaking changes, deprecation timeline, gem compatibility, load_defaults guide, detection patterns, dual-boot setup, and troubleshooting. Includes `scripts/fetch-changelogs.sh` to pull component CHANGELOGs from GitHub for any Rails version. ([PR #7](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/7))

## [6.0.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **writing-skills**: Document all agentskills.io frontmatter fields (`license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`) — previously only `name` and `description` were documented

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **Skill namespace rename**: All skill names now use `superpowers-ruby:` prefix instead of `superpowers:` to match the plugin name
- **Skill directory rename**: `skills/superpowers-compound/` → `skills/compound/`, `skills/superpowers-compound-refresh/` → `skills/compound-refresh/`
- **Session-start hook**: Updated context message to reference "superpowers for Ruby and Rails" and the `superpowers-ruby:using-superpowers` skill name

### Added

- **Skills Catalog**: Added a complete skills catalog table to the `using-superpowers` skill, organized by category (Process & Workflow, Ruby & Rails, Hotwire & Stimulus, Security, Code Review, Meta) so Claude always has the full skill index in context

### Migration Guide

**Uninstall and reinstall the plugin** to pick up the renamed skill directories and namespace changes:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin uninstall superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby
claude plugin install superpowers-ruby@superpowers-ruby

# Or re-run the installer
```

If you were using `superpowers:compound` or `superpowers:compound-refresh` by name anywhere (custom hooks, CLAUDE.md, scripts), update those references to `superpowers-ruby:compound` and `superpowers-ruby:compound-refresh`.

## [5.0.6] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **ruby-commit-message skill**: New skill for writing idiomatic Ruby-style git commit messages. Covers tense, length limits, subject/body separation, and Ruby/Rails-specific conventions for referencing classes, methods, and modules. ([PR #1](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/1))
- **superpowers:compound skill**: Captures freshly solved problems into structured `docs/solutions/` learning docs using parallel subagents. Ported from [EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin), adapted to superpowers-ruby conventions: `name`/`description`-only frontmatter, CSO-compliant trigger-first description, compressed from 1901 to 690 words. ([PR #2](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/2))
- **superpowers:compound-refresh skill**: Maintains `docs/solutions/` accuracy over time. Supports interactive and autonomous (`mode:autonomous`) modes. Four maintenance outcomes: Keep, Update, Replace, Archive. Includes Common Mistakes section covering Update/Replace confusion, Archive vs Replace with active problem domains, and autonomous report completeness. ([PR #2](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/2))

### Improved

- **ruby skill — CSO description**: Rewrote description to be trigger-first (`Use when...`) instead of leading with a content summary. Added `raise vs fail` and `memoization` as keywords so the skill surfaces for the exact questions it uniquely answers. ([PR #3](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/3))
- **ruby skill — Overview section**: Added 2-sentence overview clarifying the skill covers patterns agents miss by default — the Weirich raise/fail distinction, nil-safe memoization, result objects, and performance-conscious enumeration. ([PR #3](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/3))
- **ruby skill — Common Mistakes table**: Added 6-entry table covering `raise` vs `fail`, `||=` nil caveat, `+=` vs `<<`, `rescue Exception`, deep `&.` chains, and missing `frozen_string_literal`. ([PR #3](https://github.com/lucianghinda/superpowers-ruby/pull/3))

### Tests

- Added skill-triggering test for `compound`: naive N+1 query scenario confirms the skill triggers from a natural prompt.
- Added explicit-skill-request test for `compound-refresh`: user-named invocation test (`disable-model-invocation: true` makes auto-triggering intentionally unavailable).
- Added skill-triggering test for `ruby`: `raise` vs `fail` question — confirmed by subagent testing to discriminate skill-loaded vs memory-only answers.

## [5.0.5] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **Brainstorm server ESM fix**: Renamed `server.js` → `server.cjs` so the brainstorming server starts correctly on Node.js 22+ where the root `package.json` `"type": "module"` caused `require()` to fail. ([PR #784](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/pull/784) by @sarbojitrana, fixes [#774](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/774), [#780](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/780), [#783](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/783))
- **Brainstorm owner-PID on Windows**: Skip `BRAINSTORM_OWNER_PID` lifecycle monitoring on Windows/MSYS2 where the PID namespace is invisible to Node.js. Prevents the server from self-terminating after 60 seconds. The 30-minute idle timeout remains as the safety net. ([#770](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/770), docs from [PR #768](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/pull/768) by @lucasyhzhu-debug)
- **stop-server.sh reliability**: Verify the server process actually died before reporting success. Waits up to 2 seconds for graceful shutdown, escalates to `SIGKILL`, and reports failure if the process survives. ([#723](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/723))

### Changed

- **Execution handoff**: Restore user choice between subagent-driven-development and executing-plans after plan writing. Subagent-driven is recommended but no longer mandatory. (Reverts `5e51c3e`)
